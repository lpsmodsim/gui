The Subcomponent Creator tab will generate a skeleton for you using a
subcomponent prototype. This prototype should be located in the component header
file which uses subcomponents, as the component declares the interface it needs
and the subcomponent must conform to that definition.

Browse Header Files button - This button will let you choose a header file that
	may contain a subcomponent prototype. If a subcomponent prototype is found
	in the header file, the prototype(s) will be listed in the Available
	Subcomponent Types list for you to choose.

Selected Header File box - Contains the path to the selected header file.

Available Subcomponent Types box - Contains a list of the available subcomponent
	prototypes found in the header file shown in the Selected Header File box.

Generate Files button - This button will create a skeleton using the
	subcomponent prototype selected. This skeleton consists of a .h and .cc
	file, both of which have been filled out with the basic functions required
	by SST and the subcomponent prototype. You will need to edit the files to
	make them useful, as well as adding the .cc file to the Element's Makefile
	so that it gets built. The .h file also needs to have the correct Element
	library name added in as described in the TODO message. The .h file has
	stubs for parameters, statistics, and ports that can be filled out or
	removed.
