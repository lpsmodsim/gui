This is the SST Model Creation Tool it will assist your in developing models for
the SST Simulation Framework. This tool assumes that SST 7.1 or greater has been
installed and is running on your system. This tool will test to see if SST is
loaded onto your system. If SST is properly loaded all functionality is
available to you. If it is not only the Generate Model functionality is
available. This will allow you to create a model on your own machine then "copy"
the model to "host" where SST is loaded and run your model from there using the
command line execution methods.

As part of the model development process you will be asked edit files. This tool
will use your EDITOR environment variable as the preferred editor if it is set.
If the EDITOR environment variable is not set GEDIT is used by default. The
editors will be brought up when necessary in the model development process. The
tool allows you to exit and edit off-line if you prefer and re-enter the process
at the point where you left off.

The tool has five main regions:
    1) Global parameters at the top of the screen, and the information display
       at the bottom of the screen
    2) Model Creator Tab -> Model Creation from a template
    3) Sbcomponent Creator Tab -> Subcomponent Creation using the prototype from
       a header file
    4) Model Connector -> Connecting Multiple models together
    5) Tools Menu at the top right

Tool tips are available if you mouse over each button. More specific Help is
also availble by selecting the correct option under the Help button.
