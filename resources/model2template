The Model2Template button located on next to the Help button allows you
to create a template from a working model. Simply mouse over the Model2Template
next to "Help" and select "Run". This will bring up a file browser select
the model you want to turn into a template and press "Open". A pop-up will appear
type in the name you want use for your template and press "Ok". The files needed for 
the template (template, <template>.h, <template.cc>, test-<template>.py and the Makefile)
will appear in your chosen editor for your review. If you are satisfied with
the way the template has been created simply save and exit the editor. It should
be noted here that the template has been created from your model. The model you
created will still be present as you coded it before creating the template. This function
simply copies the model and converts it into a template for future use.
