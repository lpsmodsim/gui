The Model Connector tab will step you through connecting several
models together to form larger simulation entities. The Model Connector
will allow you to use Default SST Models, Local Modeles (available in
your current working directory) or Browse for models elsewhere on your 
computer system. This Model Connector assumes that the models have
already been compiled and contain the correct "ports" to be connectted
together. Below is a description of the buttons, check boxes and screens
available on this tab.

Enter Model Name text box - Simply enter the name of your model, this name
  will be used as the base name for your connectted model and will appear
  in a seperate directory under your current working directory. If you 
  do not enter a name the GUI will not continue until a name is entered.

Default SST Models check box - If you "check" this box it will use the
  enviroment look into the SST supplied elements directory to find
  available models to use. It will find the elements dirctory
  by using your SST_ELEMENTS_HOME enviroment variable. The available
  models will be displayed in the Available Models Screen.

LocalModels check box - If you "check" this box it will look in your
  current working directory for any models that you have created previously
  and display them in the Available Models Screen. All local models will
  have a "./" appended to the front of them to signify a model located in 
  the local directory.

Browse Models button - If you press the Browse Models button a file browser
  will appear and allow you to "browse: to a model that is located somewhere
  else on the computer system. Once you select "Open" on the file browser 
  the model appended with the entire path will appear in the Selected Models
  screen.

Available Models screen - All of the SST models, if the Default SST Models check
 box is selected and all of the local Models, if the Local Models check box is 
 selected will appear in this screen.

Selected Models screen - All "Selected" models for your simimulation entity will
 appear in this screen.

Add Model button - To move models from "Available" to "Selected" simply highlight
 the model in the Available Models screen and press the Add Model button all
 highligthed models will be selected.

Remove Model button - To remove models from the Selected Models simply highlight
 the model you want to remove and press the Remove Model button.

Generate/Open Templates button - This button will first create a directory in your 
  working directory with your model name, inside this directory you will find your 
  Makefile, and tests/<model>.py templates. The templates will also appear in an 
  editor of your choice, so you can complete the development of your combined model. 
  Create your model by editing the templates, save and close the editor. If model 
  already exists in your working directory with the same name and the Overwrite Existing
  Model check box is unchecked, the popup editor will open the 
  existing model this will allow you use the GUI to complete your model. If the box 
  is checked it will confirm if you want to overwrite the existing model, then overwrite 
  the model. 

Compile Model button - This button will run "make all" which builds the
  sst library for your combined model and then links it into sst. If an 
  error occurs in your script or because of your Makefile during the compile 
  process you can correct the errors by opening the files using the Generate/Open Templates 
  button, make sure Overwrite Existing Model is UNCHECKED, and recompile until 
  all errors are corrected. If the error is in one of your lower level models you will
  need to go outside of the tool to edit your models or close out of the Model Connectory
  tab and edit your model in the Model Creator tab.

Overwrite Existing Model check box - Generate Templates will check
  to see if a model is already present with the current name in your
  working directory. If this box is checked the old model will
  be overwritten with the new one you created.

Make Clean check box - If you select this check box Compile Model will
  run a "make clean" before running "make all"

Run SST button - This button will run the tests/<model>.py script
  (basically running your model in SST) the results will
  be displayed in the information window.

Run After Build check box - If you select this check box the tool
  will proceed directly to Run SST after Compile Model. It is suggested
  that this box remain unchecked until you at least get your model
  to compile.
