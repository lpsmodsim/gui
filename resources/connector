The Model Connector tab will step you through connecting several
models together to form larger simulation entities. The Model Connector
will allow you to use Default SST Models or Local Models (available in
your current working directory). It checks for any model that has been
"registered" with your version of SST. 

Enter Model Name text box - Simply enter the name of your model, this name
  will be used as the base name for your connectted model and will appear
  in a seperate directory under your current working directory. If you 
  do not enter a name the GUI will prompt you to enter a name and it will 
  not continue until a name is entered. If you select a name the same as 
  one of the elements already "registered" by SST, for a new install they 
  consist of elements in the delivery, an error will be thrown and the tool 
  will ask you to choose another name. A list of all "registered" SST elements 
  will appear in the Information screen, so you can pick a unique name.  

Available Models screen - This screen will list all of the model directories
  that have been registered with your version of SST, both SST supplied models and
  local models you have created. By clicking on the arrow next to the directory
  and expanding all of the register components in the directory will be displayed
  Double clicking on any directory or component will display a description of the
  component pulled from the sst-info information.To choose a model simply expand
  the directory in the available components screen (click on the arrow) and use
  your mouse to hightlight the specific element you want to choose. The tool 
  will not move the entire directory without selecting an element underneath.

Selected Models screen - All "Selected" models for your simimulation entity will
 appear in this screen. Double clicking on any dcomponent will display a detailed 
 description of the component, including port information, pulled from the sst-info
 information. Both the model directory and the "selected" models under the directory
 will be displayed in the screen

Add Model button - To move models from "Available" to "Selected" simply highlight
 the component under the directory in the Available Models screen and press the 
 Add Model button all highligthed models will be selected.

Remove Model button - To remove models from the Selected Models simply highlight
 the model you want to remove and press the Remove Model button. Unlike the "Add
 Model button" the entire directory can be removed with this button by highlighting
 directory and pressing this button. If you only want to remove a single model
 under a directory simply highlight the model and press this button only the 
 highlighted model will be removed and any other models you added will remain 
 in the "Selected Components" screen.

Generate/Open Templates button - This button will first create a directory in your 
  working directory with your model name, inside this directory you will find your 
  tests/<model>.py template. The template will also appear in an  editor of your 
  choice, selected using your EDITOR environment variable so you can complete the 
  development of your combined model. You will notice that the test python script that 
  has been created has all of the ports listed from your selected models with default 
  parameters loaded. Follow the highlighted "TODO" comments to complete your model by 
  editing the template, save and close the editor. If model already exists in your 
  working directory with the same name and the Overwrite Existing Model check box is 
  unchecked, the popup editor will open the existing model this will allow you use the 
  GUI to complete your model. If the box is checked it will confirm if you want to 
  overwrite the existing model, then overwrite the model. If you select a name the  
  same as one of the elements already "registered" by SST, for a new install they 
  consist of elements in the delivery, an error will be thrown and the tool 
  will ask you to choose another name. A list of all "registered" SST elements 
  will appear in the Information screen, so you can pick a unique name.  

Compile Model button - This button will run "make all" which builds the
  sst library for your combined model and then links it into sst. If an 
  error occurs in your script or because of your Makefile during the compile 
  process you can correct the errors by opening the files using the Generate/Open Templates 
  button, make sure Overwrite Existing Model is UNCHECKED, and recompile until 
  all errors are corrected. If the error is in one of your lower level models you will
  need to go outside of the tool to edit your models or close out of the Model Connector
  tab and edit your model in the Model Creator tab.

Overwrite Existing Model check box - Generate Templates will check
  to see if a model is already present with the current name in your
  working directory. If this box is checked the old model will
  be overwritten with the new one you created.

Make Clean check box - If you select this check box Compile Model will
  run a "make clean" before running "make all"

Run SST button - This button will run the tests/<model>.py script
  (basically running your model in SST) the results will
  be displayed in the information window.

Run After Build check box - If you select this check box the tool
  will proceed directly to Run SST after Compile Model. It is suggested
  that this box remain unchecked until you at least get your model
  to compile.

Information screen (unlabeled) - Output from various tasks run with the 
  GUI will be displayed in the information screen. Color has been added
  to highlight some of the more important information to allow it to stand
  out.
