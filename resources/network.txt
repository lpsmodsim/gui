The Network Gen tab helps you test network configurations on available network 
topologies within SST. You are presented with an easy to use interface that 
allows you to configure and reconfigure your network on the fly.

NOTE**The 'Overwrite Existing Model' checkbox is checked by default when 
	entering the Network Gen tab.**

Topology - This list is populated with all the available network
	topologies in your SST. You cannot move on unless a topology is selected.
	
Endpoint - All of the available endpoints in your SST are displayed 
	here. This list is not populated unless a topology has been selected. You 
	cannot move on until an endpoint has been selected.
	
Parameters - This is populated with all of the available parameters based 
	on the previous selection of the topology and endpoint. The bolded text is 
	a label indicating what the following parameters are for. The scroll bar 
	on both the Parameter and the Value lists are synced, so when one list 
	scrolls, the other scrolls as well. 
	
Values - This list contains the values that are associated with the 
	parameters in the previous list. This list is editable. To edit, click on 
	the value or space that corresponds to the parameter in the same row as 
	the value. For the edit to be complete, you must either hit the 'enter' 
	key or click off of the edited value. The scroll bar on both the Parameter 
	and the Value lists are synced, so when one list scrolls, the other scrolls 
	as well.
	
Generate/Open File - This button creates, or overwrites, a file 
	that has the name shown in the 'Enter Model Name' field in the directory 
	shown in the 'Model Directory' field. The file contains all the necessary 
	information for a test to be run on the network model you created.
	
Run Model - Clicking this button runs a test on the network model you 
	created. If the test encounters any errors, you will be notified in the 
	information window.
