This is the SST Model Creation Tool it will assist your in developing
models for the SST Simulation Framework. This tool assumes
that SST 7.1 or greater has been installed and is running on
your system. This tool will test to see if SST loaded onto your
system. If SST is properly loaded all functionality is available
to you. If it is not only the Generate Model functionality is
available. This will allow you to create a model on your own machine
then "copy" the model to "host" where SST is loaded and run your
model from there using the command line execution methods. 

As part of the model development process you will be asked edit
files. This tool will use your EDITOR environment
variable as the preferred editor if it is set. If the EDITOR
environment variable is not set GEDIT is used by default.
The editors will be brought up when necessary in the model
development process. The tool allows you to exit and edit off-line
if you prefer and re-enter the process at the point where you 
left off.

The tool has four main regions:

	1) Model Creation from a template (Model Creator tab)
	2) Subcomponent Creation using the prototype from a header file (Subcomponent Creator tab)
	3) Connecting Multiple models together (Model Connector tab)
	4) Tools Menu

Tool tips are available if you mouse over each button
More specific Help is also availble by selecting the correct option
under the Help button.
