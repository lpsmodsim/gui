The Model Creator tab will step you through the development
of models based on stored templates in the templates folder.
The tool comes with a series of simple templates that is updated
when appropriate. All available templates will be displayed in
the Available Templates window when you select the Model Creator 
tab. Since this tool is run from your working own
working directory you may add your own templates when you feel
it is appropriate. The tool comes equipped with button that 
will quickly convert models with proper directory structure
into templates for use later.

Enter Model Name text box - Simply enter the name of your
  model, this name will be used as the base name for all of
  your files and your model's directory. If you do not enter
  a name the GUI will not continue until a name is entered.

Select Template button - If you want to use on the supplied
  templates that appear in the Available Templates window
  as the basis for your model simply select the desired
  template by highlighting it with your mouse and press
  the Select Template button. The full path will appear 
  in the Selected Template text box.

Browse Templates button - If you want to use a
  template that is not already in the templates directory you
  can use the Browse Templates button. When you press the 
  button a file browers will appear and "browse" to location
  that contains your desired template. Then select "Open" in 
  the file browser and your template will be select. The full
  path will appear in the Selected Template text box.

Selected Template text box - If you already know the full path
  and name of the template you want to use you can simply type
  it in the Selected Template text box. 

Generate/Open Templates button - This button will first create a 
  directory in your working directory with your model name, 
  inside this directory you will find your <model>.cc, <model>.h,
  Makefile, and tests/<model>.py templates. The templates will also
  appear in an editor of your choice, so you can complete the
  development of your model. Create your model by editing the
  templates, save and close the editor. The templates do generate a
  very simple model that can be compiled and run by the tool without
  any editing if you just want to try the tool out to see how it 
  works before creating your own. If model already exists in your 
  working directory with the same name and the Overwrite Existing
  Model check box is unchecked, the popup editor will open the 
  existing model this will allow you use the GUI to complete your
  model. If the box is checked it will confirm if you want to overwrite
  the existing model, then overwrite the model. 

Compile Model button - This button will run "make all" which builds the
  sst library for your model and then links it into sst. If an 
  error occurs during the compile process you can correct the errors
  by opening the files using the Generate/Open Templates button, make
  sure Overwrite Existing Model is UNCHECKED, and recompile until 
  all errors are corrected. You do not need to close the editor
  each time simply just save the file update files and before
  pressing the Compile Model button.

Overwrite Existing Model check box - Generate Templates will check
  to see if a model is already present with the current name in your
  working directory. If this box is checked the old model will
  be overwritten with the new one you created.

Make Clean check box - If you select this check box Compile Model will
  run a "make clean" before running "make all"

Run SST button - This button will run the all the "test" files tests/
  directory (basically running your model in SST) the results will
  be displayed in the information window.

Run After Build check box - If you select this check box the tool
  will proceed directly to Run SST after Compile Model. It is suggested
  that this box remain unchecked until you at least get your model
  to compile.
