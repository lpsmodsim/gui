The Model Creator tab will step you through the development of models based on
stored templates in the templates folder. The tool comes with a series of simple
templates that is updated when appropriate. All available templates will be
displayed in the Available Templates window when you select the Model Creator
tab. Since this tool is run from your own working directory you may add your own
templates when you feel it is appropriate. The tool comes equipped with a button
that will quickly convert models with proper directory structure into templates
for use later. If you would like to test the this functionality simply type in a
model name and select a model from the Available Templates screen run through
the Generate -> Compile -> Run work flow and a simple model will be created. 

Available Templates screen - This screen will display the the available
	templates that come with a tool. A doxygen block is included at the top of
	each Template, if you need a simple discription of each model just "double
	click" the model in the screen and a simple description will be displayed in
	the information screen.

Browse Templates button - If you want to use a template that is not already in
	the templates directory you can use the Browse Templates button. When you
	press the button a file browers will appear and "browse" to location that
	contains your desired template. Then select "Open" in the file browser and
	your template will be selected. The full path will appear in the Selected
	Template text box.

Selected Template text box - Shows the path to the selected template. You can
	select a template by simply clicking on one from the Available Templates
	box, or by browsing to one using the Browse Templates button.

Generate/Open Files button - This button will first create a directory in your
	working directory with your model name, inside this directory you will find
	your <model>.cc, <model>.h, Makefile, and tests/<model>.py templates. The
	templates will also appear in an editor of your choice, so you can complete
	the development of your model. The editor is chosen by reading your EDITOR
	environment variable, if your environment variable is not set GEDIT will be
	selected by default. Create your model by editing the templates, save and
	close the editor. The templates do generate a very simple model that can be
	compiled and run by the tool without any editing if you just want to try the
	tool out to see how it works before creating your own. If model already
	exists in your working directory with the same name and the Overwrite
	Existing Model check box is unchecked, the popup editor will open the
	existing model this will allow you use the GUI to complete your model. If
	the box is checked it will confirm if you want to overwrite the existing
	model, then overwrite the model. If you select a name that is the same as
	one of the elements already "registered" by SST, for a new install they
	consist of elements in the delivery, an error will be thrown and the tool
	will ask you to choose another name. A list of all "registered" SST elements
	will appear in the Information screen, so you can pick a unique name. If
	your desire is to test certain parameters under different input conditions
	you can do "Parameter Sweeps" of up to five (5) parameters.

Make Clean check box - If you select this check box "Compile Model" will run a
	"make clean" before running "make all"

Compile Model button - This button will run "make all" which builds the SST
	library for your model and then links it into SST. If an error occurs during
	the compile process you can correct the errors by opening the files using
	the Generate/Open Templates button, make sure Overwrite Existing Model is
	UNCHECKED, and recompile until all errors are corrected. You do not need to
	close the editor each time simply just save the updated files before
	pressing the Compile Model button again.

Run After Build check box - If you select this check box the tool will proceed
	directly to Run SST after Compile Model. If the build fails the simulation
	will not run.

Run Model button - This button will run all the "test" files in the tests/
	directory (basically running your model in SST) the results will be
	displayed in the information window. It should be noted here that the model
	can be run outside of the GUI this button is just included for convenience.
	If you entered Parameter Sweep inputs the code will automatically detect the
	desired parameters, create a new test file for each combination of your
	parameter sweep, and then run all test files. It is suggested that you make
	sure your "statistics" output is written to file. The output will be written
	to the Information Screen.
