The Model Creator tab will step you through the development
of models based on stored templates in the templates folder.
The tool comes with a series of simple templates that is updated
when appropriate. All available templates will be displayed in
the Available Templates window when you select the Model Creator 
tab. Since this tool is run from your own working directory you
may add your own templates when you feel it is appropriate. The 
tool comes equipped with a button that will quickly convert models 
with proper directory structure into templates for use later. If 
you would like to test the this functionality simply type in a model 
name and select a model from the Available Templates screen run 
through the Generate -> Compile -> Run work flow and a simple model 
will be created. 

Enter Model Name text box - Simply enter the name of your
  model, this name will be used as the base name for all of
  your files and your model's directory. If you do not enter
  a name the GUI will not continue until a name is entered.

Available Templates screen - This screen will display the 
  the available templates that come with a tool. A doxygen block
  is included at the top of each Template, if you need a
  simple discription of each model just "double click" the 
  model in the screen and a simple description will be displayed
  in the information screen. 

Select Template button - If you want to use one of the supplied
  templates that appear in the Available Templates window
  as the basis for your model simply select the desired
  template by highlighting it with your mouse and press
  the Select Template button. The full path will appear 
  in the Selected Template text box. 

Browse Templates button - If you want to use a
  template that is not already in the templates directory you
  can use the Browse Templates button. When you press the 
  button a file browers will appear and "browse" to location
  that contains your desired template. Then select "Open" in 
  the file browser and your template will be selected. The full
  path will appear in the Selected Template text box.

Selected Template text box - If you already know the full path
  and name of the template you want to use you can simply type
  it in the Selected Template text box. If you do not choose a
  template by one of the three methods listed (Select Template 
  button, Browse Templates button, or typing in a template in 
  the Selected Template box) and error will occur and the tool
  will not continue until a template is selected.

Generate/Open Templates button - This button will first create a 
  directory in your working directory with your model name, 
  inside this directory you will find your <model>.cc, <model>.h,
  Makefile, and tests/<model>.py templates. The templates will also
  appear in an editor of your choice, so you can complete the
  development of your model. The editor is chosen by reading your
  EDITOR environment variable, if your environment variable is not
  set GEDIT will be selected by default. Create your model by editing the
  templates, save and close the editor. The templates do generate a
  very simple model that can be compiled and run by the tool without
  any editing if you just want to try the tool out to see how it 
  works before creating your own. If model already exists in your 
  working directory with the same name and the Overwrite Existing
  Model check box is unchecked, the popup editor will open the 
  existing model this will allow you use the GUI to complete your
  model. If the box is checked it will confirm if you want to overwrite
  the existing model, then overwrite the model. If you select a name
  that is the same as one of the elements already "registered" by
  SST, for a new install they consist of elements in the delivery,
  an error will be thrown and the tool will ask you to choose 
  another name. A list of all "registered" SST elements will 
  appear in the Information screen, so you can pick a unique
  name.  

Compile Model button - This button will run "make all" which builds the
  sst library for your model and then links it into sst. If an 
  error occurs during the compile process you can correct the errors
  by opening the files using the Generate/Open Templates button, make
  sure Overwrite Existing Model is UNCHECKED, and recompile until 
  all errors are corrected. You do not need to close the editor
  each time simply just save the updated files before
  pressing the Compile Model button again.

Overwrite Existing Model check box - Generate Templates will check
  to see if a model is already present with the current name in your
  working directory. If this box is checked the old model will
  be overwritten with the new one you created.

Make Clean check box - If you select this check box "Compile Model" will
  run a "make clean" before running "make all"

Run SST button - This button will run all the "test" files in the tests/
  directory (basically running your model in SST) the results will
  be displayed in the information window. It should be noted here that
  the model can be run outside of the GUI this button is just included
  for convenience.

Run After Build check box - If you select this check box the tool
  will proceed directly to Run SST after Compile Model. It is suggested
  that this box remain unchecked until you at least get your model
  to compile.

Information screen (unlabeled) - Output from various tasks run with the 
  GUI will be displayed in the information screen. Color has been added
  to highlight some of the more important information to allow it to stand
  out.
