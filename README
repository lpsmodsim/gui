This is a suite of productivity tools for SST. The main executable a user should use is
sstGUI.py, as it provides a simple GUI to help the user create new models, connect existing
models, and compile and run the models. sstSHELL.py is a script which can be run from the command
line, but should NOT be used directly by the user as there is no error checking on inputs. It does
however provide the core functionality to the GUI, and should be usable from scripts or other GUIs.
If you must run the sstSHELL.py executable, first run
	python3 sstSHELL.py -h
This will show you how to use the script, but again you must be careful with your input.

Along with the two main executables, there is a resources folder and a templates folder included.
The resources folder contains extra images and help files used by the GUI. If you want to learn
about how to use the GUI, you can look at the about file in the resources directory, or you can
use the Help menu from the GUI and click About.
The templates folder contains some basic templates which are used to create a skeleton for your
new model, more help on the templates can be found in the README in the templates folder.

Requirements to run the GUI:
	python3
	PyQt5
	graphviz (If you want to use the graphing capability to make a .jpg from a .dot file)

The scripts both sstGUI.py and sstSHELL.py should be run in your working directory. As you 
create new models they will reside in seperate folders inside your working directory. The
SST GUI will pick up any new models you register with your version of SST.

After running the GUI you will notice an extra folder created called __pycache__. This folder
simply contains the compiled version of sstSHELL.py and can be safely removed if desired.
If not removed, the startup time of the GUI will be slightly reduced.
