This is a suite of productivity tools for SST. The main executable a user should
use is sstGUI.py, as it provides a simple GUI to help the user create new
models, connect existing models, and compile and run the models. sstSHELL.py is
a script which can be run from the command line, but should NOT be used directly
by the user as there is no error checking on inputs. It does however provide the
core functionality to the GUI, and should be usable from scripts or other GUIs.
If you must run the sstSHELL.py executable, first run
	python3 sstSHELL.py -h
This will show you how to use the script, but you must be careful with input.

Along with the two main executables, there is a resources folder and a templates
folder included. The resources folder contains extra images and help files used
by the GUI. If you want to learn about how to use the GUI, you can look at the
about file in the resources directory, or you can use the Help menu from the GUI
and click About. The templates folder contains some basic templates which are
used to create a skeleton for your new model, more help on the templates can be
found in the README in the templates folder.

Requirements to run the GUI:
	python3
	PyQt5
	graphviz (If you want to use the graphing capability to make a .jpg)

sstGUI.py can be run from any directory on your system. sstSHELL.py should be run
from within the resources folder if needed. As you create new models they will
reside in seperate folders inside your working directory. The SST GUI will pick
up any new models you register with your version of SST.
