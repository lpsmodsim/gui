All chisel code is under the chisel folder. Other files are SST files
including Makefile, the chisel SST wrapper .cc and .h files, and the project
driver in the tests folder. Under the chisel folder, the files of interest are
in the src folder. The files under main are the actual hardware description files,
and the file under test is the PeekPokeTester that communicates with SST.
