Each template must have all files necessary inside a folder along with
a file named "template". The "template" file describes the where the files
in the template end up when they are used. The format for the file is each
line corresponds to one template file, the first item being the name of the
file in the template followed by one space, then the second item is the
path and name of the file once it is used in a model. Using the example
from the simpleModel template:

model.h <model>.h
model.cc <model>.cc
test.py tests/<model>.py
../common/Makefile Makefile

The common Makefile is used in this case as nothing special needs to be built.

model.cc is placed in the top of the model directory and uses the name <model> 
which is substituted with the first model name provided.

model.h is created the same as model.cc

test.py is placed under the tests folder in the top of the model directory 
and then named <model>.py which again is substituted with the first model 
name provided.

Any test files MUST be located under the tests/ folder otherwise the GUI will
not be able to locate the test. The GUI will run all files in the under the
tests/ folder.
