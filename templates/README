Each template must have all files necessary inside a folder along with
a file named "template". The "template" file describes the where the files
in the template end up when they are used. The format for the file is each
line corresponds to one template file, the first item being the name of the
file in the template followed by one space, then the second item is the
path and name of the file once it is used in a model. Using the example
from the simpleModel template:

Makefile Makefile
model.cc <model#1>.cc
model.h <model#1>.h
test.py tests/<model#1>.py

Makefile doesn't change names and is located in the root of the model directory

model.cc is placed in the root directory and uses the name <model#1> which is
substituted with the first model name provided

model.h works the same as model.cc

test.py is placed under the tests folder in the root directory and then named
<model#1>.py which again is substituted with the first model name provided
